# PaperChain
This is PaperChain, a blockchain-based platform that addresses the inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and outdated processes inherent in traditional document management systems. Traditional systems struggle with issues like fraud, data breaches, and manual errors. PaperChain tackles these challenges with a decentralized approach using Filecoin's infrastructure and the Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) system. The platform provides a tamper-proof record-keeping environment, leveraging smart contracts for automation and PaperChain cryptocurrency (PRC) for transactions. The integration of MetaMask further simplifies authentication, while Filecoin's decentralized storage ensures advanced cryptographic validation mechanisms to protect against document tampering and duplication. PaperChain sets a new standard for secure and transparent document management in the digital age.
